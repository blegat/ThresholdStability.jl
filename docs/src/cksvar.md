# CKSVAR models

[ThresholdStability.jl](https://github.com/samwycherley/ThresholdStability.jl) includes tools to convert censored and kinked structural vector autoregressive ([CKSVAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12779)) models into TVAR models.

Ox code to estimate CKSVAR models is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18616WKrloMiGd3x8140f-Fk8u29na6Qb/view?usp=sharing).

## Construction of automata
`CKSVAR_to_TAR` outputs a set of matrices generated in an order generated by the `perms` function (as well as a set encoding state space constraints.)

`automaton_constructor` provides a method to construct an automaton suitable for use with a CKSVAR model converted using `CKSVAR_to_TAR`, assuming this order. It is also suitable for any other set of matrices that is ordered in a similar way (see examples/AR2.jl).

Automata can also be constructed manually using [HybridSystems.jl](https://github.com/blegat/HybridSystems.jl).
