# # Testing the stability of CKSVAR models

# Here, we test the stability of the models estimated in:
# - Ikeda, Li, Mavroeidis and Zanetti (2021), "[Testing the effectiveness of monetary policy in Japan and the United States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15158)." Working paper.
# This paper is hereafter referred to as [ILMZ21].

# # Japan
# In [ILMZ21], the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy in Japan is investigated via estimation of a CKSVAR(2) model in inflation, output gap and the Call Rate for Japan, over the period 1985q3-2019q1, with shadow call rate as the latent variable.

# Converting this model into TAR form, we determine upper bounds on the constrained joint spectral radius (CJSR) and the less conservative state-constrained joint spectral radius (SCJSR)
